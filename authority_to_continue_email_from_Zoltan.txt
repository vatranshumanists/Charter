Hi, please set the Virginia branch up. My vision for the party is centric and with open arms to anyone who is interested in it. Please read some of my interviews and try to objectively choose the greater good for the movement in your policy. Feel free to add some of your own personality too.

Im not aware of anyone else doing Virginia yet.

Thanks and good luck!

PS. I've cc'd our volunteer manager for any questions. Once your up and running, pls let me know and ill try to help promote in media. I encourage people to run for various offices as well.

Thanks! Zoltan

But I wanted to make sure it's fully aligned with all the other branches and Zoltan's vision.  Also I wanted to find out if I accidentally stepped on anybody's toes by taking the initiative.
